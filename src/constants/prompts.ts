const FORMAT_RULES = `
FORMAT RULES:
1. Convert natural language periods into absolute dates:
"last 3 days" → "start_date": "{CURRENT_DATE_MINUS_3}", "end_date": "{CURRENT_DATE}"
2. If no date range or time period (like "last 5 days") is mentioned, DO NOT include the "start_date" or "end_date" fields. The system will default to the most recent messages.
3. Dates must be formatted "YYYY-MM-DD".
4. to and cc must be arrays (e.g., ["a@b.com"]).
5. If only one email is given, still use array.
6. "days" must be an integer number (no quotes).
7. Populate subject and content fields if possible, according to the user's query.
8. For SUMMARIZE tools - when to use which:
   - "summarize and send to @user" or "summarize and send to email@example.com" → use "summarize-and-send-email"
   - "summarize and send to #channel" or "summarize and send to all members of #team" → use "summarize-and-send-email-to-channel-or-team"
9. For "people" field in summarize tools:
   - If usernames have @ prefix (e.g., "@alice", "bob") → include them: ["@alice"]
   - If usernames have NO @ prefix (e.g., "alice", "bob") → use empty array: []
10. EMAIL ADDRESS EXTRACTION: When you see @username [email@example.com] in the query, extract ONLY the email from brackets:
    - "@john.doe [john@company.com]" → use "john@company.com" in "to" field
    - "@alice [alice@example.com] and @bob [bob@example.com]" → use ["alice@example.com", "bob@example.com"]
    - "@username [ ]" or "@username" → skip this user (no valid email)
    - "send to john@gmail.com and alice@company.com" → use ["john@gmail.com", "alice@company.com"]
11. MIXED RECIPIENTS: When query has both usernames with emails and direct emails:
    - Extract emails from @username [email] format
    - Include direct email addresses as-is
    - Combine all valid emails into the "to" array
    - "send to @john.gk [john@gmail.com] and alice@company.com" → use ["john@gmail.com", "alice@company.com"]
12. If user query is like "send an email" which doesn't provide any details for email content, then just generate a "Welcome to Rocket.Chat" email with longer email body.

    The summary should be easy for anyone to read, even if they were not part of the conversation. Structure your response as follows. You can tweak the structure according to the conversation(only if needed):

    1.  **MAIN POINTS:** Start with a brief, one or two-sentence overview of the entire conversation.
    2.  **KEY TOPICS & DECISIONS:** Use bullet points to list the main topics discussed and any decisions that were made.
    3.  **ACTION ITEMS:** If any, list clear action items and who they are assigned to in a separate bulleted list.

    - Categorize emails based on content, sender domain, and subject keywords
    - For user categories: Try to fit emails into the requested categories, use count 0 if none match

    - Count actual emails only - no fictional data
    - Return valid JSON only, no explanations

    STRICT VALIDATION:
