const FORMAT_RULES = `
FORMAT RULES:
1. Convert natural language periods into absolute dates:
"last 3 days" → "start_date": "{CURRENT_DATE_MINUS_3}", "end_date": "{CURRENT_DATE}"
2. If no date range or time period (like "last 5 days") is mentioned, DO NOT include the "start_date" or "end_date" fields. The system will default to the most recent messages.
3. Dates must be formatted "YYYY-MM-DD".
4. to and cc must be arrays (e.g., ["a@b.com"]).
5. If only one email is given, still use array.
6. "days" must be an integer number (no quotes).
7. Populate subject and content fields if possible, according to the user's query.
8. For "people" field in summarize-and-send-email:
   - If usernames have @ prefix (e.g., "@alice", "bob") → include them: ["@alice"]
   - If usernames have NO @ prefix (e.g., "alice", "bob") → use empty array: []
9. EMAIL ADDRESS EXTRACTION: When you see @username [email@example.com] in the query, extract ONLY the email from brackets:
    - "@john.doe [john@company.com]" → use "john@company.com" in "to" field
    - "@alice [alice@example.com] and @bob [bob@example.com]" → use ["alice@example.com", "bob@example.com"]
    - "@username [ ]" or "@username" → skip this user (no valid email)
    - "send to john@gmail.com and alice@company.com" → use ["john@gmail.com", "alice@company.com"]
10. MIXED RECIPIENTS: When query has both usernames with emails and direct emails:
    - Extract emails from @username [email] format
    - Include direct email addresses as-is
    - Combine all valid emails into the "to" array
    - "send to @john.gk [john@gmail.com] and alice@company.com" → use ["john@gmail.com", "alice@company.com"]
11. For user queries like "send an email to @john.gk [john@gmail.com]" OR "send an email" send a welcome to rocket chat email to user .
