    ---
    
    FORMAT RULES:
    1. Convert natural language periods into absolute dates:
    "last 3 days" → "start_date": "{CURRENT_DATE_MINUS_3}", "end_date": "{CURRENT_DATE}"
    2. If no date range or time period (like "last 5 days") is mentioned, DO NOT include the "start_date" or "end_date" fields. The system will default to the most recent messages.
    3. Dates must be formatted "YYYY-MM-DD".
    4. to and cc must be arrays (e.g., ["a@b.com"]).
    5. If only one email is given, still use array.
    6. "days" must be an integer number (no quotes).
    7. Populate subject and content fields if possible, according to the user's query.
    8. CRITICAL JSON FORMATTING: The email "content" field must use escaped newlines (\\n) for line breaks. Never use actual line breaks in JSON strings. Example: "content": "Dear Name,\\n\\nThank you for..."
    9. For "people" field in summarize-and-send-email:
       - If usernames have @ prefix (e.g., "@alice", "bob") → include them: ["@alice"]
       - If usernames have NO @ prefix (e.g., "alice", "bob") → use empty array: []
    10. IMPORTANT: When you see @username [email@example.com] in the query, extract the email address from the square brackets and use it in the "to" or "cc" fields. For example:
        - "@john.doe [john@company.com]" → extract "john@company.com" for the email recipient
        - "@alice [alice@example.com] and @bob [bob@example.com]" → extract ["alice@example.com", "bob@example.com"]
        - "@username [ ]" → ignore this user (no email found), do not include in email recipients
